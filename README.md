# Parking System Project

### Objective


### Problem
Create a `parking system` that allows users to perform various operations such as
**parkVehicle()**, **removeVehicle(int row, int col)** , **printParkedVehicles()** ,**isFull()** and **isEmpty()**.

### Implementation
- Create `Parking` array of boolean with 3x3 dimensions.
- Write a function `parkVehicle()` for finding the first available slot in the parking lot and marking it as occupied.
- Write a function `removeVehicle()` that takes the row and column parameters to identify the slot from which the vehicle needs to be removed. It checks if the provided row and column values are within the valid range of the parking lot's dimensions. If the slot is valid and marked as **true**, the function sets the corresponding slot to **false** to indicate that the slot is now empty.
- Write a function `printParkedVehicles()`
- Write a function `isFull()`
- Write a function `isEmpty()`

``` java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      /* add your code here */
    }

}
