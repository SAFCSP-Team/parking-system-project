# Parking System Project

### Objective
Using the concepts of data structures and algorithms 101 to solve real problems using the array

### Problem
Create a `parking system` that can accommodate 100 vehicles for the employees in SAFCSP company to help the manager assign parking for each employee. The system allows to perform various operations such as **park()**, **remove()** ,**updeteParking()** ,**printParkedVehicles()** ,**isFull()** and **isEmpty()**.

> Each employee has a name, ID, and Vehicle   
 
  

### Implementation
- Create a `Parking` 2D array that can accommodate 100 vehicles.
- Write a function `park()` for finding the parking lot's first slot and adding the employee.
- Write a function `remove()` that takes the row and column parameters to identify the slot from which the vehicle needs to be removed. If the slot is valid and occupied the function removes the employee to indicate that the slot is now empty.
- Write a function `printParkedVehicles()` to display the details of all the vehicles that are currently parked in the parking system. 
- Write a function `isFull()` to determine if all the parking slots are currently filled with vehicles.
- Write a function `isEmpty()` to determine if all the parking slots are currently empty.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      /* add your code here */
    }
